// WARNING: when working from different computers, go version can conflict with gopls.
// Update this file accordingly to the go version installed. Actually not true, 
// gopls needs go 1.23 in this file, dunno why. That even didn't come out yet. 
// Run :LspLog in Nvim to check the gopls ERROR and see which go version it needs to match. 
// `go version` to check installed version.
