// The 6502 is an 8-bit processor internally, but it has a 16-bit address bus for addressing memory locations.
// This allows it to work with a larger address space even though its data bus is 8 bits wide.

    // Stack Pointer is a 8-bit register that holds the low 8bits of the next free
    // location on the stack. Pushing bytes to the stack causes the Stack Pointer to be 
    // decremented. The CPU does not detect if the stack is overflowed by excessive pushing or
    // pulling operations and will most likely result in the program crashing.
    SP Word 

    // Accumulator register is used for all arithmetical and logical operations.
    // Exception made for intcrements and decrements. The contents of the accumulator
    // can be stored and retrieved either from memory or the stack.

    // The X register is most commonly used to hold counters and offsets for accessing.
    // It has one special purpose, which is to get a copy of the SP or change its value.
